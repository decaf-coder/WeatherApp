# WeatherApp

This app includes a text input field where the user can enter the name of a city, and a button which
they can click that will retrieve that city's current weather from OpenWeatherAPI. It also includes a toggle button to 
switch units from Celcius to Fahrenheit.  

When the app is opened it will request permission to use the users current location, and then display the 
weather at their location without having to search. It does this using Google play services. If location is already permitted, 
the app will open to the current location!!
